Prevent Automatic Updates If TestFlight on your iPhone is set to Autoupdate for any app, it will immediately replace your existing copy of that app when a new update is released. But if an update to iAPS resets your Preferences, you will lose all the Settings you have set, and if you have not saved a recent copy of them, you will have to go through the entire Setup process agan. To stop this from happening: Open TestFlight on your iPhone Tap on the iAPS app TURN Off Automatic Updates under App Information Repeat this process on any other devices that have iAPS listed in TestFlight. 1.1 How To Use This Documentation You can click on a Topic or first-level Sub-Topic on the left to display it in the View Pane (this Pane).

It’s just a way of turning up or down the aggressiveness/slope of ISF curve. It determines the aggressiveness of the DynamicISF algorithm, and it tends to be person-specific. 4.1.1 Switch On Sigmoid Function Settings -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Dynamic Settings -&gt; Use Sigmoid Function The Sigmoid Function uses a Logarithmic Scale to calculate Dynamic ISF. If you are just switching to using it, you can get to a ballpark Adjustment Factor with the Sigmoid Function enabled by dividing what you have now by 1.666. NOTE: This is only your new starting point. You will need to make further adjustments to suit your condition. The actual formula is: F = 1800 / profile.sens * tdd_averages.average_14days * LN( profile.min_bg / ( 120 - pumpprofile.insulinPeakTime + 1 ) Each of the above variables points to the Debug Options screen + variable within it that you would need to use, but again, this will get you only to ballpark: you will want to monitor and tweak Adjustment Factor accordingly. If you find it’s not aggressive enough, increase AF, if it’s too aggressive, decrease AF. NOTE: You can use a different value for tdd_averages.average_14days if you want. This smooths out the good and bad days that we all have. 4.1.2 Ballpark Formula There is a formula for deriving an approximate number to begin with: adjustmentFactor = 277700/TDD * BG_target * (18 * 18) * StaticISF Total Daily Delivery (TDD) can be found by tapping the green circle at the top of the main iAPS page. There are three numbers in the purple area: TDD, Weighted Average (Wavg), and 14day. Use the TDD value. BG_Target is whatever you have chosen for your target, e.g. 5.5. Use the Autotune value for StaticISF Settings –&gt; Configuration –&gt; Autotune Autotune runs automatically every day, but you may want to run it now if it hasn’t run for a while. The Autotune value also can be found in Settings -&gt; Configuration –&gt; Insulin Sensitivities –&gt; Autotune –&gt; Calculated Sensitivity Using some example numbers, the AdjustmentFactor will be: 277700 / ( 2.31 * 78.75 * 5.5 * ( 18 * 18 ) * 2.31) = 0.856 It isn’t 100% accurate, but it gets you into the ballpark range, and you can tweak up or down from there. 4.2 AutoSens Basically, AutoSens determines how sensitive or resistant you are to insulin. Its value is dynamically calculated by the system. If Autosens is calculated to be 1, it means that there is no change from those Settings that affect insulin delivery. More than 1 means that you need more insulin than usual Less than 1 means you are currently more sensitive and need less insulin 4.2.1 Autosens Default Settings The default Autosens settings are Autosens Max: 1.2 and Autosens Min: 0.8. The only way to always have Autosens set to 1 (disabling both Autosens and Dynamic ISF) is to have both Autosens Max and Autosens Min set to 1. Oref0 can of course compute your Autosens to 1 (when not using Dynamic ISF). This happens on two occasions: When there isn’t enough data for Autosens, and When the Autosens functions don’t compute a change in insulin sensitivity. 4.2.2 Autosens Can Be Disabled Autosens is disabled (actually overridden) when using Dynamic ISF, except for the exception when you’re using a high Temp target together with one of the two exercise settings, because at these occasions Dynamic ISF gets temporarily disabled. Dynamic ISF borrows the Autosens Max.Min settings for limiting the dynamic ratio. So even it it’s still called Autosen Max/Min, it isn’t an Autosens setting when you have Dynamic ISF toggled on. A full explanation of AutoSens can found in the OpenAPS documentation. "],["fine-tuning-using-your-log-files.html", "5 Fine-Tuning Using Your Log Files 5.1 Copying Your Log Files to Your Mac 5.2 Setting UAMSMB/SMB Limitations", " 5 Fine-Tuning Using Your Log Files 5.1 Copying Your Log Files to Your Mac You must first create and copy FreeAPS-ng log files from your iPhone to your Mac computer. Tap Share logs at the bottom of Settings in iAPS This will create two log files, log.txt and log_prev.txt, and open a screen allowing you to transfer them by a variety of methods. Save these files on your Mac in a Folder of your choice Leave the Folder window open on your Desktop 5.2 Setting UAMSMB/SMB Limitations 5.2.1 Safety Limiters The following Settings act as “safety limiters”: Max UAMSMB Basal Minutes Max SMB Basal Minutes Autosens Max Autosens Min They do they not affect calculations except by putting up fences. The primary focus on a new setup is to have initial Settings* so that the system is immediately able to function adequately using its default calculations. But if your Basal Minutes is set to 30 and your Basal Rate is .1, and the app wants to give you an SMB of 2U, the Basal Minutes setting will limit it to .5U at a time, and your blood sugar will be high forever. So you will want to increase Basal Minutes to a value that allows the algorithm to do its job. The ideal is to create Settings that allow 95% of any UAMSMB/SMB calculation made by iAPS to influence insulin delivery. For this we need to ensure that: SMB is not limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes SMB is not limited by maxSMBBasalMinutes Dynamic ISF limited by autosens_max setting: 1.3 (1.3) To understand SMB and its limitations factors, you can read: Understanding Super Micro Bolus (SMB) in the OpenAPS documentation. 5.2.2 Open Terminal on Your Mac The Terminal application is in Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal 5.2.2.1 SHORTCUT to open Terminal Click on the Desktop in Finder Hold the [COMMAND] key then tap the [SPACEBAR] Start typing terminal when the Spotlight Search bar opens Press [RETURN/ENTER] to open the Terminal application 5.2.2.2 Change focus to the Log File Directory Type cd [SPACE] in Terminal Switch to Finder Drag the small Folder icon where you saved the log files, into the Terminal window path/to/the/log/files/folder will appear next to cd Press [ENTER/RETURN]. This will change Terminal to the log file directory. You can type ls then tap [RETURN/ENTER] to list the log files. The following commands will now work correctly. 5.2.3 Find and Compare The Ratio of SMB-Limited Lines First, find find the total number of lines from the log pertinent to each. Copy and paste the first line of each command (below), after the $ prompt. The first line is the command, the second the returned result: grep maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes log.txt | grep limited | wc -l 114 Then find the number of lines that are SMB-limited: grep maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes log.txt | grep &quot;SMB limited&quot; | wc -l 57 Compare the two results. If the number of limited lines is more than 5% (in the above examples it obviously is), you need to adjust maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes, guided by these log reports. Sort the result by calculated units (the last value on the line): grep maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes log.txt | grep &quot;SMB limited&quot; | sort -n +20 Scroll through the search results to see how much the algorithm is limiting insulin delivery. The overall idea is to “ignore” the extreme SMBs. In the log file, you will see lines similar to: DEV: JavaScript log: SMB is not limited by MaxUAMSMBBasalMinutes. ( insulinReq: 0.53U ) DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 6.28U ) There will be entries for both maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes and maxSMBBasalMinutes Optimally, you want to have more “not limited” lines then limited, with limited lines being less then 5% of all of the lines. If they are less than 5% of all lines, you don’t need to change your settings. To adjust maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes to reduce the percentage of lines that are limited, look for the line that represents about the mid-way of limited values. For example, if you have something like: DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 6.28U ) DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 5.72U ) DEV: JavaScript log: SMB limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes [ 60m ]: 1.5U ( 6.1U ) Use the entry with 6.1U as your adjustment point, with the formula: 60m * ( 6.1 / 1.5 ) = 240 And use the rounded results for your new value in maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes. Do the maths and up your UAMSMB basal minutes by that amount. For example: the algorithm bolused 1U insulin when it says it really wanted to bolus 3U, so increase UAMBasalMinutes by 3x in Settings. If you need to adjust, there are going to be more lines then the above to work with, but the value in parenthesis is what the system has calculated you require in the way of insulin, and the value outside is the limit BASED ON BasalMinutes. The 1.5U will vary depending on time of day, as its determined by your Basal Rate at the time of calculation. When you make the change, give it 24 hours before checking and adjusting again. 5.2.4 An Easier Way for the Rest of Us Heres a much easier way for non-technical people: * Email log files to yourself * Open log_prev.txt * Press [CONTROL/COMMAND] + F to perform a search * Enter e.g. SMB is limited by maxUAMSMBBasalMinutes into the Search field. * Press [RETURN/ENTER] Search for either is limited or is not limited to get the numbers for both. If the [limited]/[is not limited] x 100 is less than 5 (5%), then dont change anything. 5.2.5 Checking The Results To check this (except the first day or so), run the above commands on the log_prev.txt file, which reports the previous 24-hour period. Leave it run for a full day before rechecking. If everything else is set up correctly for you, these SMB maximums wont be needed in the future. But now you can know for sure that they are based on the results returned in your log files. "],["bolusing-for-meals.html", "6 Bolusing for Meals 6.1 Rule-of-Thumb Meal Bolusing 6.2 Let iAPS Do Its Work", " 6 Bolusing for Meals FreeAPS (FAX) does not actually give meal bolus recommendations as does Loop. Here’s what the Meals section of LoopAndLearn FreeAPS docs recommends: The built-in function to give a bolus is not a bolus calculator in the same way as Loop has one, so don’t expect it to give you enough insulin. It takes the insulinReq calculation and uses it to provide a bolus estimate. The insulinReq value is calculated based on a number of prediction curves, and when carbs are added, it mediates the effect of carbs with the other curves. It’s not a bolus calculator. The insulinReq value is not necessarily as much insulin as the normal meal bolus would be (it’s conservative for safety reasons). The recommendation with oref1 is to bolus 60%-75% of required meal bolus and leave the algorithm to deal with variation in absorption. This is the way most people use it. 6.1 Rule-of-Thumb Meal Bolusing Rather than pull out a calculator, one pre-bolus strategy might be to form a rule-of-thumb scale for yourself like the following. You should make your own based on your needs and Carb Ratio (CR): Small meal 20g or less –&gt; 2U Medium-size meal 20g-40g –&gt; 3U Big meal 40g or more –&gt; 4U Your scale should be based upon your carb ratio and the % of upfront bolus that you prefer. For example, with a Carb Ratio of 10, the above meal boluses would provide a: * 100% upfront bolus for 20g * 75% upfront bolus for 40g, and * 67% upfront bolus for 60g 6.2 Let iAPS Do Its Work With an appropriate pre-bolus and Settings, you should NOT need to issue manual boluses after your meal. This may be a difficult task coming from Loop! If you used automatic bolus with Loop or the FreeAPS fork, youll find Temp Basal a little slower than you are used to, but its worth taking the time to test and adjust your settings before you turn on SMB/UAM. Observe for a few days and make adjustments as needed so that you wont have to issue correction meal boluses. (Thanks to LoopAndLearn for this.)

Elliott Inc. (BCDiabetes) https://w.smrtwvr.com/w/5fc54955413f2/web/ 9.1 Background Diabetes causes the level of glucose (sugar) in your blood to become too high. It happens when your body cannot produce enough of a hormone called insulin, which controls blood glucose. The advent of Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS, also known as Automated Insulin Delivery systems or AID) has provided the potential to significantly improve diabetes management and quality of life among people living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in real-life conditions. Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS or APSs) are the combination of a smart insulin pump, integrated CGM and interoperable automated glycemic controller (typically a smartphone with the necessary apps). APSs are sometimes called closed-loop systems, because they work near-automatically, with minimal user input. When properly managed, APSs offer eligible patients with Type 1 diabetes or Type 2 diabetes superior glycemic control and safety over conventional treatments. APSs have been in use since 2008 for people living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, but until 2018 these were all experimental. Treatments and devices are called experimental when they have not been fully approved by a national regulatory agency. In Canada this agency is called Health Canada; in the United States the agency is called the FDA; in Europe the agency is called the EMA. Currently a number of APSs are available but some are still experimental including all Do-it-Yourself (DIY) APSs, those that are not solely commercially manufactured, produced, and implemented. If you are reading this document you may be considering using a DIY APS. All DIY APSs are still experimental. When a drug or device is approved for medical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States or Health Canada, the manufacturer produces a label to explain its use. Once a device/medication is approved by the FDA or Health Canada, physicians may prescribe it according to the label or use it off-label for other purposes. They may only prescribe it off-label if they are well-informed about the product, base its use on firm scientific methods and sound medical evidence, and maintain records of its use and effects. Although both the **Omnipod* Eros* and Dash pumps and Dexcom G6 CGM are individually approved by Health Canada, the FDA and the EMA, their use together in a DIY APS is off-label and the entire DIY APS is considered experimental. This is because the software driving DIY APSs is not approved by any agency. 9.2 What We Believe BCDiabetes believes that it should continue to offer people who use APSs, either DIY or commercial systems, the care and support they deserve and to which they are entitled. BCDiabetes cannot recommend the use of DIY APSs because no DIY APS is currently approved by any regulatory agency, including Health Canada. BCDiabetes must ensure that people with diabetes who are using, or planning to use a DIY APS, do so at their own risk. This is because DIY APSs, no matter how sophisticated they appear, are still considered experimental. These DIY closed-loop systems have typically been built by people with diabetes or parents of children with diabetes, for their personal use (or that of their children). Safety is a major consideration for people building and using these systems. People intending to use DIY APSs should be aware that they do this at their own risk, they may not receive support from their healthcare professional with any technical issues and that liability is unclear if there is a malfunction, error or problem. People intending to use DIY APSs should be competent and confident in optimizing their diabetes management using an insulin pump and CGM or flash glucose monitoring device. People intending to use a DIY APS can access support from the online DIY technology community for advice and troubleshooting. However, they must be aware that this advice is not regulated and they do so at their own risk. 9.3 Approved AP Systems There are currently two commercial APSs approved by Health Canada (and three or more approved by the FDA and the EMA) some of which may not be fully covered by BC Pharmacare or private or public drug insurance providers. This link describes all insulin pump systems, including APSs available in Canada. Medtronic 670G and 770G tubed system that currently offers temp basal adjustment. The pump and tubing are covered by BC Pharmacare but the Medtronic Guardian 3 CGM is not covered by BC Pharmacare. Tandem T-slim Control IQ tubed system that offers temp basal and microbolus adjustment: the Dexcom G6 CGM is covered by BC Pharmacare but the Tandem T-slim pump itself is not covered by BC Pharmacare. Health Canada is currently considering two other commercial APS submissions: The Omnipod 5 system tubeless pump system (the pump of which, the **Omnipod Dash, is covered by BC Pharmacare and the CGM of which, the Dexcom G6* CGM, is also covered by BC Pharmacare) with experimental proprietary software (approved by the FDA in 2022-May). The Ypsomed tubed system (the pump of which, the Ypsopump, is covered by BC Pharmacare and the CGM of which, the Dexcom G6 CGM, is also covered by BC Pharmacare) with experimental CAMAPS software (approved by the EMA in 2021). 9.4 This Consent and Waiver This consent and waiver covers the experimental use of three experimental software systems: Loop, freeAPS X and androidAPS (DIY smartphone apps, together Closed Loop Apps) that work in conjunction with approved devices like the Dexcom G6 CGM and the tubeless Omnipod insulin pump. The Closed Loop Apps are not approved by Health Canada, the FDA or the EMA. However, Loop was submitted to the FDA for approval on June 12, 2020 by Tidepool (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization) based on an observational study of 873 Loopers as its primary evidence. In early 2021 Lum and colleagues described self-reported outcomes for 553 Loopers. AndroidAPS was shown to be safe and efficacious in a study of 12 subjects by Gawrecki and colleagues 2021-Apr-5 – because freeAPSX uses the same AP algorithm as androidAPS (openAPS) – it is assumed that freeAPSX is equally as safe and efficacious as androidAPS. As of 2022-Jul-26 BCDiabetes has installed and supported 171 Type 1 clients with Loop (n=58), androidAPS (n=12) and freeAPSX (n=101) for 3+ months with no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or DKA and average improvements in Time in Range and A1c of 19% and 0.7% respectively accompanied by significant reductions in Diabetes Distress and Fear of Hypoglycemia. However, the number of systems installed and supported and the related data remain limited. 9.4.1 Hardware Components The hardware components of these three Closed Loop App systems (the Omnipod pump and Dexcom G6) are both covered by BC Pharmacare and approved by Health Canada. BCDiabetes has observed through its support of patients using the experimental Closed Loop App APSs that these Closed Looped App systems offer equivalent or superior glucose control/incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and quality of life when compared to Medtronic and Tandem systems approved by Health Canada and the Omnipod 5* FDA-approved system at a lower price (hardware covered by BC Pharmacare).

By installing a Closed Loop App on my phone (or a phone provided to me by BCDiabetes) with the assistance of BCDiabetes employees, I, the undersigned, hereby: Confirm that I had otherwise planned to set up a Closed Loop App myself using a standard DIY installation however given its complexity I consider that it is in my best interest to have the installation done professionally at BCDiabetes; Understand the nature and anticipated effect of what is proposed including the significant risks and Health Canada approved alternatives available have been explained to me and I am satisfied with these explanations and I have understood them; Understand that the Dexcom G6 and the Omnipod insulin patch pump are both approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in patients 2 years old and older.

As such, I understand that BCDiabetes does not guarantee access to updated/renewed iOS Closed Loop Apps through their Apple Developer TestFlight account; Understand and accept that, at any time without notification, the Closed Loop Apps may no longer be available without prior notice; In the event Close Loop App access is interrupted or canceled, I understand that I will need to immediately revert to an alternative insulin delivery system (retail or otherwise) to manage my diabetes or build the app myself from source code; Agree not to copy (except for reasons of personal secure backup) or share this Closed Loop Apps with any other individual or entity without the express written consent of BCDiabetes. 9.5.1 Individual Patient Data (IPD) Sharing Statement The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the patient use of any Closed Loop Apps supported by BCDiabetes will be stored in a secure non-publicly available cloud repository maintained by Google Canada.
